# hackday-sparta-bootstrap-app
A crude prototype of a Actionpad app I made, (Lime Bootstrap) fetching data from Sparta and rendering it inside the Actionpad of LimeCRM's desktop client. This was during a hack day on June 5 2018. 

Note: very much a work in progress and crude hack. Lots of good learnings gained though for future work on this concept.
